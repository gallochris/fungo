<p>This is a riff off the <a href="https://fungo.hotdogsandeggs.com/sheed-wallace-waffles/">Rasheed Wallace Waffles</a> post. It looks at college and pro three-point rates for four Tar Heels that played at least 16 seasons in the NBA using a dumbbell plot to show the change.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how much the game changed, and Vince Carter’s rate actually went down. Carter played 22 years in the league. About 31 percent of Carter’s shot attempts were from thee-point land as a collegiate player, and about 29 percent as a pro.</p>
<p>Carter’s three-point percentage was 36.8 in college, and a 37.1 in the NBA. Consistency.</p>
<p>The data was pulled from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">basketball-reference.com</a> and the <a href="https://goheels.com/documents/2019/10/30/2019_19_UNC_Men_s_Basketball_Record_Book.pdf">UNC Record Book</a>. This plot uses the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggalt/index.html">ggalt package</a>. The <a href="https://data-se.netlify.app/2018/05/23/playing-around-with-dumbbell-plots/">tutorial here</a>) was helpful.</p>
