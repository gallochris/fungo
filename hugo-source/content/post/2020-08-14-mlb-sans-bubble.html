<p>Major League Baseball without a bubble is strange. Through August 14, the St.Â Louis Cardinals have played only five games.</p>
<p>10 percent of the league (three teams) have played less that 15 total games. While almost a quarter (23.3 percent) of the league has played 20 games.</p>
<p>The data was pulled from <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2020-standings.shtml">baseball-reference.com</a>. This plot uses the Economist theme.</p>
