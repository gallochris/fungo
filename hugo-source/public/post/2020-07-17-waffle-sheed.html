<p>Rasheed Wallace is one of my favorite basketball players. This uses a waffle chart to display his points distribution in both college and the NBA.</p>
<p>Wallace attempted only four three-point shots in his collegiate career. This means only 0.67 percent of his shot attempts at North Carolina were behind the three-point line.</p>
<p>He played 18 years in the NBA and attempted 3,228 three-point shots. 23.9 percent of his shots came from three-point land as a pro, and he scored ~21 percent of his points in the NBA via the three-point shot.</p>
<p>Built using the <a href="https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle">waffle package</a>.</p>
<p>Data via <a href="https://goheels.com/documents/2019/10/30/2019_19_UNC_Men_s_Basketball_Record_Book.pdf">UNC Record Book</a> and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallara01.html">Basketball Reference</a>.</p>
