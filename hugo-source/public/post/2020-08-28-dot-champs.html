<p>This is a dotchart showing the University of North Carolina team championships by sport. It includes NCAA and ITA (tennis) events for any teams.</p>
<p>Women’s soccer has 22 of Carolina’s 51 team National Championships. While women’s soccer owns 43 percent of all team titles, it hasn’t won any of the last 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women’s Tennis (4)</li>
<li>Field Hockey (2)</li>
<li>Women’s Lacrosse (2)</li>
<li>Men’s Basketball (1)</li>
<li>Men’s Tennis (1)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is pulled from <a href="https://goheels.com/news/2015/6/10/205473190.aspx">goheels.com</a>. This plot uses the Economist theme and leaned on <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>
