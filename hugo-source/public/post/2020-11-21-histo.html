<p>How many NFL teams have won a game without scoring a touchdown since 2000?</p>
<p>This histogram answers that question. Since 2000, 68 total teams have won a game in the regular season or playoffs without scoring a touchdown. Only two of those games were in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The data here is pulled from <a href="https://stathead.com/">stathead.com</a> by Sports-Reference. A Stathead membership is like a library card to the largest sports history treasure trove. This data was pulled in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>This uses the ggplot package and economist theme.</p>
<p>Code is below . . .</p>
