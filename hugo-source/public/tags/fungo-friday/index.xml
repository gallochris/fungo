      <description>FiveThirtyEight wrote an article about Roy Williams recently, and it in it discusses how his teamâ€™s do not attempt as many three-point shots compared to the rest of college basketball.
Williams has been around a long time. 30 plus years as a head coach. College basketball has changed quite a lot. Williams has not.
This is a line plot showing how free throw rate and three-point attempt rate has changed since 1987.</description>

      <description>Rasheed Wallace is one of my favorite basketball players. This uses a waffle chart to display his points distribution in both college and the NBA.
Wallace attempted only four three-point shots in his collegiate career. This means only 0.67 percent of his shot attempts at North Carolina were behind the three-point line.
He played 18 years in the NBA and attempted 3,228 three-point shots. 23.9 percent of his shots came from three-point land as a pro, and he scored ~21 percent of his points in the NBA via the three-point shot.</description>
