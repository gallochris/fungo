      <description>This is distribution plot using ridges to show the four factors on offense for Carolina basketball in the 2020-21 season.
The plot is annotated to show the median values of each ridge, and the lines use quantiles.
The goal of this graph was to try to show the consistency in certain factors, especially turnover rate.
Code is below . . .
library(tidyverse) library(ggridges) ggplot(data, aes(x = value, y = factor, fill = factor)) + stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) + theme_me() + theme(legend.</description>

      <description>This is plot showing points distribution for Carolina basketball across two-pointers in the paint, two-pointers outside the paint, three-pointers, and free throws.
It uses the ggchicklet package, and it was inspired by Owen J. Phillips’ awesome newsletter - F5.
This one was particularly tricky to apply the text of the percentages. A few required different adjusting to show the percentages on the graph.

      <description>This is line chart showing how offensive rating has changed game to game for RJ Davis and Caleb Love. These two players have only turned in an offensive rating above 100 in two of 14 games thus far.
Individual offensive rating is the number of points produced by a player per hundred total individual possessions. In other words, How many points is a player likely to generate when he tries?</description>

      <description>This is plot showing four factor values for Carolina basketball on offense against Syracuse. The data is pulled from app.dadgumboxscores.com, and it includes 12 different games.
It uses geom_jitter to space the values out across the different four factor categories. It intercepts at line 40 and annontates the plot to show seven of the 12 games have an offensive rebounding rate over 40.

      <description>## [1] &amp;quot;nonturn.pct&amp;quot; &amp;quot;turn.pct&amp;quot; This is a waffle chart showing Carolina’s offensive turnover rate through six games.
It’s built off this example from Owen J. Phillips.
It uses the geom_waffle package and cowplot package.

      <description>Carolina has made 24 of 89 three-point shots through six games.
That is a putrid ~27 percent.
This annotated line chart shows how that incomplete sample size compares to past season three-point percentages in the Roy Williams Era, including when the line was moved back.
Code is below . . .

      <description>Carolina’s free throw rate is 45.8 (163 FTA / 356 FGA) through six games.
Would be highest mark in Roy Williams Era, of course, this is in a silly small sample size.
Tar Heels have made 25 more free throws than opponents have attempted.
This bar chart shows how that margin compares to other full seasons.

      <description>This is a plot showing the frequency of turnover rates in the Roy Williams Era since 2010. It uses geom_smooth and annotates that Carolina has had a turnover rate of 20 or higher in 5 of 6 games thus far.

      <description>How many NFL teams have won a game without scoring a touchdown since 2000?
This histogram answers that question. Since 2000, 68 total teams have won a game in the regular season or playoffs without scoring a touchdown. Only two of those games were in the playoffs.
The data here is pulled from stathead.com by Sports-Reference. A Stathead membership is like a library card to the largest sports history treasure trove.</description>

      <description>Here is a scatter plot showing all NBA first round draft picks out of North Carolina since 1976. The draft has changed a ton. Fewer rounds. Expansion teams. Eligibility rules.
But there is always round one.
Random notes:
 16 of Carolina’s 21 top five picks came from 1976 to 1998 three instances of Tar Heels being drafted back-to-back in the top five the last Tar Heel picked in round one of the 2009 draft is the only one still in the league today  The data is pulled from basketball.</description>

      <description>This is a riff off the Rasheed Wallace Waffles post. It looks at college and pro three-point rates for four Tar Heels that played at least 16 seasons in the NBA using a dumbbell plot to show the change.
It’s incredible how much the game changed, and Vince Carter’s rate actually went down. Carter played 22 years in the league. About 31 percent of Carter’s shot attempts were from thee-point land as a collegiate player, and about 29 percent as a pro.</description>

      <description>FiveThirtyEight wrote an article about Roy Williams recently, and it in it discusses how his team’s do not attempt as many three-point shots compared to the rest of college basketball.
Williams has been around a long time. 30 plus years as a head coach. College basketball has changed quite a lot. Williams has not.
This is a line plot showing how free throw rate and three-point attempt rate has changed since 1987.</description>

      <description>Rasheed Wallace is one of my favorite basketball players. This uses a waffle chart to display his points distribution in both college and the NBA.
Wallace attempted only four three-point shots in his collegiate career. This means only 0.67 percent of his shot attempts at North Carolina were behind the three-point line.
He played 18 years in the NBA and attempted 3,228 three-point shots. 23.9 percent of his shots came from three-point land as a pro, and he scored ~21 percent of his points in the NBA via the three-point shot.</description>
