      <description>This is a riff off the Rasheed Wallace Waffles post. It looks at college and pro three-point rates for four Tar Heels that played at least 16 seasons in the NBA using a dumbbell plot to show the change.
It’s incredible how much the game changed, and Vince Carter’s rate actually went down. Carter played 22 years in the league. About 31 percent of Carter’s shot attempts were from thee-point land as a collegiate player, and about 29 percent as a pro.</description>

      <description>FiveThirtyEight wrote an article about Roy Williams recently, and it in it discusses how his team’s do not attempt as many three-point shots compared to the rest of college basketball.
Williams has been around a long time. 30 plus years as a head coach. College basketball has changed quite a lot. Williams has not.
This is a line plot showing how free throw rate and three-point attempt rate has changed since 1987.</description>

      <description>Rasheed Wallace is one of my favorite basketball players. This uses a waffle chart to display his points distribution in both college and the NBA.
Wallace attempted only four three-point shots in his collegiate career. This means only 0.67 percent of his shot attempts at North Carolina were behind the three-point line.
He played 18 years in the NBA and attempted 3,228 three-point shots. 23.9 percent of his shots came from three-point land as a pro, and he scored ~21 percent of his points in the NBA via the three-point shot.</description>
