<p>FiveThirtyEight wrote an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/happy-birthday-to-roy-williams-the-coach-who-never-changes/">article about Roy Williams</a> recently, and it in it discusses <em>how</em> his team’s do not attempt as many three-point shots compared to the rest of college basketball.</p>
<p>Williams has been around a long time. 30 plus years as a head coach. College basketball has changed quite a lot. Williams has not.</p>
<p>This is a line plot showing how free throw rate and three-point attempt rate has changed since 1987. It doesn’t factor in rule changes, only the raw data via <a href="https://kenpom.com/trends.php">kenpom.com</a>.</p>
<p>Teams attempt three-point shots more often than free throws in today’s game.</p>
<p>This riffs on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html">economist theme</a> and uses <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2 package</a>. The <a href="http://t-redactyl.io/blog/2015/12/creating-plots-in-r-using-ggplot2-part-1-line-plots.html">tutorials here</a> are handy.</p>
<p>Code is below . . .</p>
<pre><code>library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)

charts.data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;kpdata.csv&quot;)

charts.data &lt;- as.data.frame(charts.data)
charts.data$product &lt;- factor(charts.data$product, levels = c(&quot;three&quot;,&quot;free&quot;),
                              labels = c(&quot;Three-Point Attempt Rate&quot;,&quot;Free Throw Rate&quot;))

p1 &lt;- ggplot() + theme_economist() + scale_colour_economist() +
  geom_line(aes(y = rate, x = year, colour = product), size=1.5, data = charts.data,
            stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
  theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;, legend.direction=&quot;horizontil&quot;,
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1988,2020,4)) +
  labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Rate&quot;, 
title = &quot;Median Division-I Three-Point Attempt Rate and Free Throw Rate Since 1987&quot;,
        caption = &quot;Data source: kenpom.com&quot;)
